ðŸ§­ Step-by-Step: Upload to Shared Drive via HTTP
1. Get the Shared Drive ID
Use the Drive API to list shared drives:

http
GET https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/drives
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
This will return a list of shared drives and their id values.

2. Upload File to Shared Drive
Use the uploadType=multipart method with metadata and file content.

HTTP POST Request:

Code
POST https://www.googleapis.com/upload/drive/v3/files?uploadType=multipart&supportsAllDrives=true
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
Content-Type: multipart/related; boundary=boundary123
Body:

Code
--boundary123
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

{
  "name": "yourfile.xlsx",
  "parents": ["SHARED_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID"],
  "driveId": "YOUR_SHARED_DRIVE_ID"
}

--boundary123
Content-Type: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

[Base64-encoded content here]

--boundary123--
Replace:

YOUR_SHARED_DRIVE_ID with the ID of the shared drive

SHARED_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID with the folder ID inside the shared drive (optional)

[Base64-encoded content here] with the actual base64 content of your Excel file

ðŸ§  Notes
If you're uploading to the root of the shared drive, omit the "parents" field.

Make sure to set supportsAllDrives=true in the URL.

You can also use includeItemsFromAllDrives=true when listing or searching files.
